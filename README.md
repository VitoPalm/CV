# My Curriculum Vitae
I designed my CV in Figma from 0, creating all the components myself, and worked on re-implementing it completely in HTML/CSS.

## Struggles
I first **exported** the project from Figma through a **plugin**. This resulted in a really **broken** version of my initial project, despite the use of:
- **Components** that I standardized for use throughout the CV
- Project-wide **variables** for colors
- **Styles** for typography

I then did a **complete refactor**:
- Reduced how verbose the HTML file was by removing unused wrapper tags
- Standardized the structure of all HTML elements
- Deleted useless and overly-specific CSS classes
- Added generalized classes that reflected the ones used in the original Figma project

## Points to improve
The spacing is still off for some components, and it needs a deeper look
