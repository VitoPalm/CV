# CV from Figma to HTML/CSS
I designed my CV in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1595132651643486440) from 0, creating all the components myself, and worked on re-implementing it completely in HTML/CSS.

## Struggles
I first **exported** the project from Figma through a **plugin**. This resulted in a really **broken** version of my initial project, despite the use of:
- **Components** that I standardized for use throughout the CV
- Project-wide **variables** for colors
- **Styles** for typography

I then did a **complete refactor**:
- **Reduced verbosity** of the HTML file by removing unused wrapper tags
- **Standardized** the structure of all HTML elements
- **Deleted** useless and overly-specific CSS classes
- Added **generalized classes** that reflected the ones used in the original Figma project

## Points of improvement
The spacing is still off for some components, and it needs a deeper look
